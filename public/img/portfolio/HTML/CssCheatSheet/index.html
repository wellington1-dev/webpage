            Henry Cavill, who starred as Superman in Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and 
            Justice League, is reportedly saying farewell to the so-called DC Extended Universe.<br>

            According to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros. had sought to sign the actor for a 
            long-rumored cameo in Shazam! However, sources indicate that negotiations broke down, pointing 
            to the end of Cavill’s time in the iconic red cape.

            The outlet contends the studio is turning a page on its cinematic universe, with a focus shifting
             away from the Man of Steel and toward a Supergirl film, reported just last month to be in 
             development.

            The reason for the negotiations impasse isn’t clear, with THR citing one Warner Bros. source as saying
             it came down to a scheduling conflict — after all, Cavill did just sign on to Netflix’s The Witcher —
              while another implied it may have come down to the studio’s desire to chart another course for its 
              DC films after a rocky start.

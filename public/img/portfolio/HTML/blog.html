            <p>Artists Dave Gibbons and Roz Chast will be inducted into The Harvey Awards Hall of Fame at 
                the 30th awards ceremony on October 5 at New York Comic Con 2018. Additionally, 
                the International Spotlight Awards will be presented to Harold Sakuishi and the inaugural 
                Comics Industry Pioneer honor, to Jackie Estrada.
                <br>

                    Hall of Fame inductee Dave Gibbons is best known for his work with Alan Moore on their 
                    seminal DC graphic novel Watchmen. Fittingly, it was at the very first Harvey Awards 
                    ceremony in 1988 that Gibbons and Moore won a slew of awards for the now-iconic superhero
                     tale. The book went on to inform the comic book medium for years after its release and is
                      still held in high regard today. Gibbons has also provided the art for countless other 
                      iconic comics in his time, including Green Lantern, Give Me Liberty and Kingsman.</p>
